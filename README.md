Down below you will find a modified version of the Polybar baked-in [Arcolinux-Hefftor-HLWM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwWSqCDeWgk). 

***Hmmm... I know you also want to listen to this song... Hey, [Don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVd0s7scl5U) tell [anybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ4r_kcvClE)...*** <br />

***I added my City to the Weather Moduled, & Bye bye, Discord... Chromium is in the building!!!***<br />
I just did some light changes on its weather module, I changed the Discord module to Browser (Chromium). <br />

***Yeah, my laptop screen is prety small... So, I did what I had to do. I know, It's sad..***<br />
The padding between the Modules had to be resized to '1' to fit on my Thinkpad-T430 Screen. <br />

***Without that Awesome Font, I Wouldn't Be Able To Enable the Browser Icon... It was close...***<br />
I Imported the Icomoon font to the 'config' file, so that, I was able to enable the Chromium Browser Icon. <br />

***Hm... As I Sad, My Laptop Screen Is Pretty Small. It was Needed.*** <br />
And to wrap it up, I also removed the Memory Ram Module, just to get more room on the Polybar. <br />


##
In order to use that 'Browser Icon' on the Polybar, don't forget to install 'Chromium'.

<pre>trizen -S chromium</pre>


## Hey, bruh, what if I don't want to use Chromium Browser? <br />

Well, It's pretty simple. You just need to go to:<br />

<pre>/home/vicyos/.config/polybar/</pre>

And edit the 'Config' file. <br />
