Down below you will find a modified version of the Polybar baked-in [Arcolinux-Hefftor-HLWM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwWSqCDeWgk). 
I just did some light changes on its weather module, I changed the Discord module to Browser (Chromium).
The padding between the Modules had to be resized to '1' to fit on my Thinkpad-T430 Monitor.
I Imported the Icomoon font to the 'config' file, so that, I was able to enable the Chromium Browser Icon, 
and to wrap it up, I also removed the Memory Ram Module, just to get more room on the Polybar. <br />
