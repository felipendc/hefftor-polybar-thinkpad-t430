# // Yeah, my laptop screen prety small... So I did what I had to do. I know, it's sad...
The padding between the Modules had to be resized to '1' to fit on my Thinkpad-T430 Monitor. <br />

# // Without that Awesome Font, I Wouldn't Be Able To Enable the Browser Icon... It was close...
I Imported the Icomoon font to the 'config' file, so that, I was able to enable the Chromium Browser Icon. <br />

# // Hm... As I Sad, My Laptop Screen Is Pretty Small. It was Needed. 
and to wrap it up, I also removed the Memory Ram Module, just to get more room on the Polybar. <br />
